# Happy Thoughts

Happy Thought app, is a single-page application to which user can submit New Text on this app. 
-There is a form to post new thoughts and submit button. 

-Users can see a list of the most recent thoughts at the top and older thoughts at the bottom. 

-In this project I work with useEffect to call an API, then use GET- and POST-requests to display and add new thoughts/likes to a list of happy thoughts.
-All components have their own CSS styling components.
-In app.jsx I made Props and used them in different components according to the needs.

This project has been very helpful for me to understand the concept of React components, usage of states, and sending data through functions and props, and a better understanding of the app.js component which holds all the data and pass it down the waterfall.

## The problem
- I spent a good amount of time trying to display when a thought was liked. 
- That was a bit difficult to connected all components to each others, by using reverse method solve that problem. 
- If I would have more time I would make another components to count heart or likes.

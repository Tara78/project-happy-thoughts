Happy Thought app, is a single-page application to which you can submit your feeling on this app. 
There is a form to post new thoughts and submit them. 
Users can see a list of the most recent thoughts at the top and older thoughts at the bottom. 

In this project I work with useEffect to call an API, then use GET- and POST-requests to display and add new thoughts/likes to a list of happy thoughts.
This project has been very helpful for me to understand the concept of React components, usage of states, and sending data through functions and props, and a better understanding of the app.js component which holds all the data and pass it down the waterfall.

#The Problem
I spent a good amount of time trying to display when a thought was liked.
